# Models and Collections for Vue.js

# **GET STARTED**

This library is designed to conveniently manipulate the state of components and divide business logic and manipulation
into different levels of abstraction.

The basic concept is based on models (`Model`) and collections (` Colection`).
(See [vue-mc](https://vuemc.io/#introduction))

The library provides a single point of entry and a consistent API:
* GRUD operations.
* Manage model states.
